1951 CONVENTION RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES
AND 1967 PROTOCOL — KEY PROVISIONS

PREAMBLE
The High Contracting Parties, considering that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination, and considering that the United Nations has manifested its profound concern for refugees, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1 — DEFINITION OF THE TERM "REFUGEE"
A. For the purposes of the present Convention, the term "refugee" shall apply to any person who:
(2) As a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.

The 1967 Protocol removed the dateline restriction, making the Convention universally applicable. A refugee under current law is any person with a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, who is outside their country of nationality and unable or unwilling to return.

B. The term "refugee" shall cease to apply when the person:
(1) has voluntarily re-availed themselves of the protection of the country of their nationality;
(2) has voluntarily reacquired their lost nationality;
(3) has acquired a new nationality and enjoys protection of that country;
(4) has voluntarily re-established themselves in the country which they left out of fear of persecution;
(5) can no longer refuse to avail themselves of the protection of their country because the circumstances in connection with which they have been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist;
(6) being stateless, is able to return to their country of former habitual residence.

ARTICLE 3 — NON-DISCRIMINATION
The Contracting States shall apply the provisions of this Convention to refugees without discrimination as to race, religion, or country of origin.

ARTICLE 4 — RELIGION
The Contracting States shall accord to refugees within their territories treatment at least as favorable as that accorded to their nationals with respect to freedom to practice their religion and freedom as regards the religious education of their children.

ARTICLE 12 — PERSONAL STATUS
The personal status of a refugee shall be governed by the law of the country of his domicile or, if he has no domicile, by the law of the country of his residence.

ARTICLE 13 — MOVABLE AND IMMOVABLE PROPERTY
The Contracting States shall accord to a refugee treatment as favorable as possible and, in any event, not less favorable than that accorded to aliens generally in the same circumstances, as regards the acquisition of movable and immovable property and other rights pertaining thereto, and to leases and other contracts relating to movable and immovable property.

ARTICLE 17 — WAGE-EARNING EMPLOYMENT
The Contracting States shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the most favorable treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign country in the same circumstances, as regards the right to engage in wage-earning employment.

ARTICLE 18 — SELF-EMPLOYMENT
The Contracting States shall accord to a refugee lawfully in their territory treatment as favorable as possible and, in any event, not less favorable than that accorded to aliens generally in the same circumstances, with respect to the right to engage on his own account in agriculture, industry, handicrafts and commerce and to establish commercial and industrial companies.

ARTICLE 22 — PUBLIC EDUCATION
The Contracting States shall accord to refugees the same treatment as is accorded to nationals with respect to elementary education.

ARTICLE 23 — PUBLIC RELIEF
The Contracting States shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals.

ARTICLE 24 — LABOUR LEGISLATION AND SOCIAL SECURITY
The Contracting States shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment as is accorded to nationals in respect of labor legislation and social security (insurance for accidents, occupational disease, maternity, illness, disability, old age, death, unemployment, family responsibilities, and other contingencies covered by national legislation).

ARTICLE 26 — FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
Each Contracting State shall accord to refugees lawfully in its territory the right to choose their place of residence and to move freely within its territory subject to any regulations applicable to aliens generally in the same circumstances.

ARTICLE 27 — IDENTITY PAPERS
The Contracting States shall issue identity papers to any refugee in their territory who does not possess a valid travel document.

ARTICLE 28 — TRAVEL DOCUMENTS
The Contracting States shall issue to refugees lawfully staying in their territory travel documents for the purpose of travel outside their territory, unless compelling reasons of national security or public order otherwise require. The document shall be valid for as long a period as possible and for at least one year.

ARTICLE 31 — REFUGEES UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY OF REFUGE
The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of Article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.

ARTICLE 32 — EXPULSION
The Contracting States shall not expel a refugee lawfully in their territory save on grounds of national security or public order. The expulsion of such a refugee shall be only in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with due process of law. The refugee shall be allowed to submit evidence to clear themselves, to appeal to and be represented before a competent authority.

ARTICLE 33 — NON-REFOULEMENT (PROHIBITION OF EXPULSION OR RETURN)
No Contracting State shall expel or return ("refouler") a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The benefit of this provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country.

NON-REFOULEMENT is the cornerstone of international refugee protection. It is considered a jus cogens norm of customary international law, binding even on states that have not signed the Convention. It prohibits returning any person to a place where they face a real risk of serious harm, including torture, cruel treatment, or persecution.

ARTICLE 34 — NATURALIZATION
The Contracting States shall as far as possible facilitate the assimilation and naturalization of refugees. They shall in particular make every effort to expedite naturalization proceedings and to reduce as far as possible the charges and costs of such proceedings.

GROUNDS FOR PERSECUTION (Article 1A(2) — Expanded Interpretation)
Race: Includes ethnicity and ancestry. Persecution on grounds of race includes measures directed against members of a racial group, or persons perceived to belong to a racial group.
Religion: Includes theistic, non-theistic, and atheistic beliefs, as well as freedom to change religion, and freedom to practice religion alone or in community.
Nationality: Encompasses citizenship, ethnicity, language, and cultural identity.
Political Opinion: Includes any opinion on any matter in which the machinery of the State, government, or society may be engaged. An applicant need not have expressed their political opinion where there is a risk of persecution based on imputed political opinion.
Particular Social Group: A group of persons who share a common characteristic other than their risk of persecution, or who are perceived as a group by society. The characteristic must be innate, unchangeable, or so fundamental to identity or conscience that the person should not be required to renounce it. Examples include: LGBTQ+ individuals, women subjected to gender-based violence, victims of domestic violence, former members of military, clan or family associations, landowners in land reform contexts.

WELL-FOUNDED FEAR — STANDARD OF PROOF
The applicant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable possibility (not certainty) of persecution. Both subjective fear (the applicant genuinely fears persecution) and objective basis (the fear is reasonable in light of country conditions) must be established. The standard is significantly lower than a preponderance of evidence — even a 10% chance of persecution may suffice.
