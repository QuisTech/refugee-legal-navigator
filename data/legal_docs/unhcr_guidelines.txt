UNHCR GUIDELINES ON INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION

UNHCR MANDATE AND ROLE
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems. UNHCR's primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. UNHCR pursues this mission through international protection, emergency assistance, durable solutions, and advocacy.

UNHCR DEFINITION OF A REFUGEE (Broader Mandate)
In addition to the 1951 Convention definition, UNHCR's mandate encompasses persons outside their country who are unable or unwilling to return due to serious and indiscriminate threats to life, physical integrity or freedom resulting from generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order (OAU Convention, Cartagena Declaration). This broader definition applies in many African and Latin American countries.

THE THREE DURABLE SOLUTIONS

1. VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION
Voluntary repatriation is the return of refugees to their country of origin in safety and dignity. UNHCR facilitates voluntary repatriation when conditions in the country of origin have improved sufficiently to make return possible. Repatriation must be voluntary — refugees cannot be forced to return. UNHCR assists with transportation, reintegration packages, and monitoring.

2. LOCAL INTEGRATION
Local integration allows refugees to settle permanently in the country of asylum. This involves granting refugees the right to remain, to work, to access social services, and eventually to adjust to permanent residence or citizenship. It is a long-term solution requiring strong host government commitment.

3. RESETTLEMENT
Resettlement is the transfer of refugees from the country of asylum to a third country that has agreed to admit them as refugees with permanent residence status. UNHCR refers refugees for resettlement when the refugee faces particular vulnerabilities. In 2023, approximately 2.4 million refugees were in need of resettlement globally, but only around 100,000 resettlement places were made available by states each year.

RESETTLEMENT CRITERIA — UNHCR
UNHCR considers refugees for resettlement referral on the following grounds:
- Legal and physical protection needs (including risk of refoulement or arbitrary detention)
- Survivors of violence and torture
- Medical needs that cannot be treated in the country of asylum
- Women and girls at risk (gender-based violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation)
- Family reunification
- Children and adolescents at risk (unaccompanied or separated children, child labor, child marriage)
- Lack of foreseeable alternative durable solutions

UNHCR REFUGEE STATUS DETERMINATION (RSD)
In countries where the national government does not conduct refugee status determination, UNHCR conducts RSD on behalf of the state. UNHCR RSD involves:
- Registration of asylum seekers
- Assessment of whether the applicant meets the refugee definition
- Consideration of exclusion clauses (Articles 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F of the 1951 Convention)
- Decision and notification
- Right to appeal a negative decision

STATELESS PERSONS
In addition to refugees, UNHCR is mandated to prevent and reduce statelessness and to protect stateless persons. A stateless person is someone who is not considered a national by any State under the operation of its law. Stateless persons may be at risk of detention, inability to register births, marriages, or deaths, lack of access to education, healthcare, employment, and freedom of movement. Stateless persons may also qualify for refugee protection if they fear persecution.

PROTECTION FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS

Women and Girls: Gender-based persecution includes sexual violence, female genital mutilation (FGM/C), forced marriage, honor crimes, and trafficking. UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection No. 1 (Gender-Related Persecution) provides that women persecuted for transgressing social norms may qualify under "particular social group."

LGBTIQ+ Persons: UNHCR recognizes LGBTIQ+ persons as members of a "particular social group" for refugee protection purposes. Persecution based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including criminalization of same-sex conduct and threats of violence, supports asylum claims.

Unaccompanied and Separated Children: UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection No. 8 (Child Asylum Claims) emphasizes child-sensitive procedures, best interests determination, and appointed guardians. Children may have independent international protection needs.

Victims of Trafficking: Victims of human trafficking may qualify for refugee protection if they have been trafficked for reasons related to a protected ground or if they fear retaliation, re-trafficking, or persecution by state actors upon return.

Religious Minorities: Persecution of religious minorities includes prohibitions on worship or religious instruction, violence against religious communities, and forced conversion. The right to freedom of religion includes the right to change religion and to practice religion publicly.

Ethnic and Cultural Minorities: Persecution of ethnic minorities includes ethnic cleansing, forced assimilation, denial of language rights, and systematic discrimination amounting to persecution.

UNHCR GUIDANCE ON NON-REFOULEMENT
Non-refoulement applies to everyone who might be a refugee, including asylum seekers whose status has not been formally determined. States must not return anyone to a risk of serious harm, including torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (as protected under CAT and ICCPR Article 7). Non-refoulement applies at borders, in international waters, and in extraterritorial zones.

UNHCR GUIDANCE ON DETENTION
The detention of asylum seekers and refugees is inherently undesirable. Detention must be used only as a last resort, must be proportionate, and must not be punitive. Asylum seekers should not be detained solely for the purpose of determining immigration status. Alternatives to detention must be considered first. UNHCR advocates for community-based alternatives to detention (ATD) programs.

UNHCR GLOBAL TRENDS
As of 2023, there were approximately 110 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, including 36.4 million refugees under UNHCR's mandate, 5.9 million Palestine refugees under UNRWA's mandate, 62.5 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), and 5.2 million asylum seekers. The largest refugee populations originate from Syria, Ukraine, Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Myanmar.

UNHCR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN INFORMATION (COI)
UNHCR publishes country guidance notes, eligibility guidelines, and country of origin information for many countries of origin of refugees. These documents are frequently used by immigration courts and asylum officers to assess country conditions. They cover: security situation, human rights violations, persecution of specific groups, government protection, and internal relocation options.

ACCESS TO ASYLUM
States must provide access to a fair and efficient asylum procedure. Asylum seekers must be informed of their rights. Interpreters must be provided. Applications must be individually assessed. Decisions must be reasoned and subject to appeal. Asylum seekers must be protected from refoulement while their claim is pending. Effective access to legal assistance must be facilitated.

FAIR HEARING PRINCIPLES
- The applicant must have adequate time and opportunity to prepare and present their claim
- The applicant must be interviewed by a trained and impartial decision-maker
- An interpreter must be provided in a language the applicant understands
- Confidentiality must be maintained — authorities from the country of origin must not be informed of the asylum application
- The applicant must not be discriminated against on grounds of gender, age, disability, sexuality, or other protected characteristics
- A negative decision must be explained in full, with an effective right of appeal before an independent body

INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS
States that have ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are bound to protect refugees within their territory. As of 2024, 149 states have ratified the 1951 Convention. Key obligations include: non-refoulement, non-penalization for illegal entry, provision of identity documents, access to courts, freedom of movement, right to work, access to education, and access to social security.
